## Switching to Gassitpi based radio:
**Benefits:**
* Get a google home like thing
* Can play songs by request from YouTube
* Voice control everything
* Standard Raspbian OS (no fighting volumio when updating, etc.)
* Simple Python based control

**Downsides**
* No web UI (yet?)
* Pretty slow calling up songs and radio stations

## MPV commands:
* Start with: `mpv --no-video --playlist=/path/to/playlist/stereoio.pls --playlist-start=pos --input-ipc-server=/tmp/mpvsocket --mute=yes`
    - Probably want this to kick on at startup.
    - `stereoio.pls` is just a plaintext file with radio urls on each line.
    - `pos` is a 0-based index value of which line in the playlist you want to play. Should be read from a file representing the current physical position of the tuner knob.
    - `mute=yes` starts the radio muted, this is so the rpi can powercycle without turning on the radio
    - `--input-ipc-server=/tmp/mpvsocket` allows you to pass valid json to the running mpv instance. The following commands are ones we will want:
        1. echo '{"command": ["playlist-pos", 1] }' | socat - /tmp/mpvsocket [change to playlist position 1]
        2. { "command": ["cycle", "mute"] }
        3. { "command": ["cycle", "pause"] }
* Can have multiple instances of MPV running with different /tmp/sockets. Probably don't want more than like 3 since the Rpi is small and might get over worked.

## ToDo:
- [X] Order DAC (HiFiBerry AMP2)
- [ ] Wire up volume knob [try this?](https://gist.github.com/thijstriemstra/6396142f426aeffb0c1c6507fb2acd7b)
- [X] Add platform for varicap tuner base
- [ ] find way to wire varicap to pot
- [ ] Wire up tuner knob (same way as volume knob?)
- [ ] Switch to turn off microphone
- [ ] Switch for changing music source? (radio, YouTube, Pandora, Spotify?)
- [ ] Mute button
- [ ] Stop button
- [ ] Wire up as much as I can for temporary use even if not using yet.
- [ ] Wire lights to on/off switch
- [ ] Since stereoio can be controlled by voice, have a physical switch to read physical settings and change if different from settings generated by voice control.
