## Switching to Gassitpi based radio:
**Benefits:**
* Get a google home like thing
* Can play songs by request from YouTube
* Voice control everything
* Standard Raspbian OS (no fighting volumio when updating, etc.)
* Simple Python based control

**Downsides**
* No web UI (yet?)
* Pretty slow calling up songs and radio stations

## ToDo:
- [X] Order DAC (HiFiBerry AMP2)
- [ ] Wire up volume knob [try this?](https://gist.github.com/thijstriemstra/6396142f426aeffb0c1c6507fb2acd7b)
- [ ] Add platform for varicap tuner base
- [ ] find way to wire varicap to pot
- [ ] Wire up tuner knob (same way as volume knob?)
- [ ] Switch to turn off microphone
- [ ] Switch for changing music source? (radio, YouTube, Pandora, Spotify?)
- [ ] Mute button
- [ ] Stop button
- [ ] Wire up as much as I can for temporary use even if not using yet.
- [ ] Wire lights to on/off switch
- [ ] Since stereoio can be controlled by voice, have a physical switch to read physical settings and change if different from settings generated by voice control.
